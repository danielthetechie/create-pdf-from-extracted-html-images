# What it does

From an HTML file, extract the image sources from all the &lt;img&gt; tags in the file and create a new PDF document with them.

# Usage

1. Paste your HTML in a file.
2. In the terminal, call

`python main.py html_file_origin.txt pdf_destination.pdf`

where `html_file_origin.txt` contains your HTML code and `pdf_destination.pdf` is the PDf file name. These file names are just an example. Call them whatever you want.
